# PowerBI_Reports
Here are some of the reports created by me using Microsoft PowerBI.

First one is 'painel_rh'. It is a Human Resourcers panel created from a desorganized datasheet from a fictitious company. The process of extraction and transformation was performed in PowerBI using PowerQuery. In the report there are two interactive panels: one is an Overview, where the main data, such as hirings, demissions, headcount, time series, age group, gender, schooling, sector and role are shown. The second one is a Detailed Role View, containing a table that shows the number of employees in each company's role.
